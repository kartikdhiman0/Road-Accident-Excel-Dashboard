#  Road Accident Dashboard   

This project is an interactive **Road Accident Dashboard** built in **Microsoft Excel**, providing deep insights into accident data. The dashboard helps in analyzing accident trends, casualties, and road conditions to identify patterns and improve road safety.  

##  Features  
âœ” **Comprehensive Metrics** â€“ Displays key accident statistics, including fatal, serious, and slight casualties.  
âœ” **Vehicle Type Breakdown** â€“ Shows casualties by different vehicle types such as cars, bikes, and buses.  
âœ” **Time-Based Trends** â€“ A monthly comparison chart to observe patterns over the years.  
âœ” **Road Type & Condition Analysis** â€“ Highlights accident distribution across road types (dual carriageway, roundabouts, slip roads) and conditions (wet, dry, icy).  
âœ” **Interactive Filters** â€“ Allows users to filter accident data by year for better trend analysis.  

##  Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ Built using Excelâ€™s **Pivot Tables, Power Query, Power Pivot, and Charts** for data visualization.  
- **Slicers & Filters** â€“ Added interactive elements for better usability.  

##  Insights from the Dashboard  
ðŸ”¹ The majority of accidents involved **cars**, contributing to over **44%** of casualties.  
ðŸ”¹ **Single carriageway roads** accounted for the highest number of accidents.  
ðŸ”¹ Most accidents occurred on **dry road conditions**, but wet roads still pose significant risks.  
ðŸ”¹ **Slight casualties** make up **84%** of total casualties, while **fatalities** remain lower but critical.  

##  Project Structure  
- **Dashboard.xlsx** â€“ The main file containing the interactive dashboard.  
- **Raw Data Sheet** â€“ Contains the dataset used for analysis.  
- **KPIs & Charts Sheet** â€“ Houses calculated KPIs and supporting charts.  
 
This project aims to enhance road safety awareness by presenting data-driven insights in an intuitive format. Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
